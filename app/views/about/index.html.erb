  <div class="panel-body">
  Our founder is just a small town girl livin' in a lonely world.
  She took the midnight train goin' anywhere.
  
  Our product manager is just a city boy
  born and raised in south Detroit
  he took the midnight train goin' anywhere. <br> <br>


  Our graphic design team is a singer in a smoky room
  where you can always detect a smell of wine and cheap perfume
  All members of our team will gladly settle for a smile, and then they can share the night
  it goes on and on, and on, and on.
  <br><br>
  We see you, our customers as strangers waiting
  up and down the boulevard!
  Your shadows searching in the night.
  As you live out your days, we hope you encounter streetlights, and people
  living just to find emotion.
  Your secret purchases hiding somewhere in the night.

  <br><br>
  Our team is always working hard to get their fill
  everybody wants a thrill!
  We deeply care about how we advertise our stock so that our customers feel like payin' anything to roll the dice
  just one more time.
  Our strict no refunds policy guerantees that some will win, some will lose
  some were born to sing the blues.
